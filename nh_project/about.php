		<h2>About Leader</h2>

		<p class="quote">"A lot of people ask me what my personal philosophy is.  The truth is, I find philosophies limiting, and limits are one thing we don't do here." - Leader</p>

		<p>Leader came from humble beginnings, as all great people do.  After all, you have to start from the bottom to move up.  Her <strike>authoritarian</strike> authoritative but fair style of leadership is what made New Heights the community of intensely successful people it is today.  Leader, in large part, owes her thirst for success from her experience living in [REDACTED]-- although she is also quick to credit the unyeilding support of her loyal brother, [REDACTED].</p>

		<h2 align="right">About Members</h2>

		<p class="quote" align="right">"I didn't get the memo that we were supposed to wear beige pants today." - [REDACTED]</p>

		<p align="right">Leader's brother, also known as [REDACTED], is hailed as one of the first members of New Heights.  He is said to have been with New Heights since its inception, and is rumored to even be its co-creator.  Nowadays, [REDACTED] is more keen to shine behind the scenes and let his sister shape the <strike>cult's</strike> community's image into the shining pinnacle of a self-improvement you know and love.</p>

		<p align="right">That's not to say [REDACTED] doesn't have an important role here at New Heights.  In fact, it could be said that [REDACTED] has the most important role of all, next to Leader's!  What is that role, you ask?  Well, making sure prospective members are up to snuff of course (more to come on that at a later time)!</p>

		<p align="right"><strike>And indoctrination.  He helps with that too.</strike></p>
